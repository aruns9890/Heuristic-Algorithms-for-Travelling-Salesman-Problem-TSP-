Heuristic Algorithms for Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Project Summary

In this project, I implemented and analyzed three heuristic algorithms to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for a set of 100 cities. The algorithms explored were:

City Swap: This basic heuristic involves swapping the order of cities in a given tour to reduce the total travel distance.

Simulated Annealing (SA): This probabilistic technique mimics the process of annealing in metallurgy. It explores the solution space by allowing occasional uphill moves, helping to escape local minima and approach the global optimum.

Genetic Algorithms (GA): This evolutionary approach uses a population of solutions, applying operations such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve better solutions over generations.

Performance Analysis

The algorithms were evaluated based on two key criteria:

Execution Time: Measured the computational efficiency of each algorithm.
Solution Accuracy: Compared the solutions found by each algorithm to the known optimal solution for the 100-city TSP.
Key Findings

Simulated Annealing (SA) achieved results three times faster than Genetic Algorithms (GA), demonstrating superior efficiency.
The solution provided by SA had only a 5% deviation from the optimal value, indicating high accuracy and effectiveness in finding near-optimal solutions rapidly.
This project showcases the potential of heuristic methods in efficiently solving complex optimization problems like the TSP, with Simulated Annealing providing a balanced trade-off between speed and solution quality.
